# Retire in x year

## What this is
A simple app that takes in some value of money and baseline scenario of investing in safe S&P 500 stocks to give an estimate on how long does a person need to work to achieve financial freedom (hopefully) if it is possible.

This is also my own way of expressing retaliation towards our currently broken capitalism system of life.

## What this shows
Python OOP

Python GUI software program

Tax calculation

# Important note!
This project uses a currently on-development repo [Custom Tkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) as one of its dependencies, as I am writing this there are still some parts of the library that's not completely functional from the official release such as CTkTextbox, check the current development branch for the most current build
